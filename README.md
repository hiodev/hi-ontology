# Hearing Impairment Ontology
The Hearing Impairment Ontology (HIO) is a collaboratively developed resource by a group of experts in different aspects of hearing impairment (HI) to provide a common controlled HI terminology and concepts.  The HIO will allow researchers and clinicians alike to readily access standardised HI-related knowledge in a single location and promote collaborations and HI information sharing, including epidemiological, socio-environmental, biomedical, genetic and phenotypic information. It is worth noting, this ontology provides an illustration of the adaptability of the [Sickle Cell Disease Ontology](https://github.com/scdodev/scdo-ontology) framework for use in developing a disease-specific ontology.

### Stable release versions

It is freely available under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 Unported License] (CC:https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode) and further copyrighted to maintain the quality and integrity of the term vocabulary, meaning that any modification to the HIO can only be done by HIO developers and curators.
